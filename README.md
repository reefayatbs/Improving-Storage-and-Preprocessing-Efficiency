# Improving Storage and Preprocessing Efficiency

***Project Overview***

This project focuses on enhancing the storage efficiency and preprocessing time for a dataset used to predict job changes among data scientists. The primary objective is to optimize data preparation workflows, leading to faster and more resource-efficient model training. The resulting dataframe utilized 96% less storage than the original dataframe, without losing out on any features or units of observation. The resulting data was also approximately 30% faster to preprocess for training.

The time taken for data preparation and model training was recorded and compared for both datasets.
